# Project Title

*Support for the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) Data Access and Exchanges Program.*

The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS-JPO) Data Access and Exchanges Program seeks to enhance how agencies that collect/generate ITS or transportation data manage, access, and use those data throughout the transportation ecosystem, to support the next generation of ITS technologies. Capability maturity models (CMM) have proven effective at helping agencies avoid failed projects and continuously improve their processes across multiple categories (dimensions). The Data Access and Exchanges Program developed a data management CMM designed to determine the level of readiness of an organization to produce, collect, analyze, integrate, disseminate/share, store, maintain, support, and retire data. This CMM can assess the technical and organizational capability maturity of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its modal administrations/offices. This CMM can also assess the capabilities of institutions and organizations external to USDOT, such as State departments of transportation (DOTs), municipal DOTs, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), university research centers, transit agencies, and other entities.

## Release Notes

#### Release 102 (April 30, 2024)
- Initial public release

## Getting Started

Instructions for tool users: Click into the Releases menu on the right-hand side of the screen in GitHub. Download the tool ZIP file (Data.CMM.tool.zip). Once downloaded, right-click on the ZIP file and select Properties > Unblock. Once the ZIP file is unblocked, unzip the files by right-clicking on the ZIP file and selecting Extract All. Once the files are unzipped, either read the guidelines document (e.g., Data CMM Guidelines Apr 2024.docx) or launch the tool (Data CMM.exe). Since the tool is unsigned, it might not be allowed to run on some computers depending on their antivirus or organization’s rules. Users who encounter this issue can download the source code (see "Instructions for tool developers" below) and compile a signed version of the tool in Visual Studio (applications built locally may not need to be signed to run on that same machine).

Instructions for tool developers: Click into the Releases menu on the right-hand side of the screen in GitHub. Download the source code ZIP file (Data-Capability-Maturity-Model-DataCMM.zip). Once downloaded, right-click on the ZIP file and select Properties > Unblock. Once the ZIP file is unblocked, unzip the files by right-clicking on the ZIP file and selecting Extract All. Once the files are unzipped, open the solution file (Data CMM.sln) in Visual Studio 2019 or later.

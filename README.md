# Project Title

*Support for the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) Data Access and Exchanges Program.*

The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS-JPO) Data Access and Exchanges Program seeks to enhance how agencies that collect/generate ITS or transportation data manage, access, and use those data throughout the transportation ecosystem, to support the next generation of ITS technologies. Capability maturity models (CMM) have proven effective at helping agencies avoid failed projects and continuously improve their processes across multiple categories (dimensions). The Data Access and Exchanges Program developed a data management CMM designed to determine the level of readiness of an organization to produce, collect, analyze, integrate, disseminate/share, store, maintain, support, and retire data. This CMM can assess the technical and organizational capability maturity of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its modal administrations/offices. This CMM can also assess the capabilities of institutions and organizations external to USDOT, such as State departments of transportation (DOTs), municipal DOTs, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), university research centers, transit agencies, and other entities.
